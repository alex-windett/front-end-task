# Rapha Front End Developer Task

I have created a simple layout for the sunglasses product. It has been tested in Safari and Chrome (Canary) and works as expected.

I have used some node modules so please run `npm install`,  I have used the same custom grunt tasks as you provided so `grunt build` will compile, minify and shrink all the files you need.
